#+TITLE Installing Apache HTTPD on Windows

Installing Apache HTTPD on Windows is fairly straight‐forward, but
I’ve never been a huge fan of the upgrade procedure on live systems:
shutdown the service, uninstall it, install the new one, start the
service and pray that nothing breaks.

To cut down on the risk and downtime we came up with a slightly
different way of handling it.

Instead of downloading the installer, grab the zip version, I
recommend the ones from [[http://www.apachelounge.com/]]. Remember to
install any other requirements, like the VC redistributable package.

#+BEGIN_SRC bat :exports code
  cd d:\apache\2.4.17
  bin\httpd.exe -k install -n "Apache 2.4.17"

  bin\httpd.exe -t

  cd d:\apache\2.4.10
  bin\httpd.exe -k uninstall "Apache 2.4.10"
#+END_SRC
