</header><p>
Last week at work we had a minor issue with our public website. We're
using Drupal with a MySQL backend and <code>mysqldump</code> for backups which
we're then compressing, and, in an act of idiocy, are storing on the
same drive. We hadn't run into any problems previously because the
database is supposed to be <i>significantly</i> smaller than the disk and
always has been<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>.
</p>

<p>
Until last week.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org55a3f49" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org55a3f49">Friday</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org55a3f49">
<p>
Towards the end of the week I got a resigned phone call from our
web-team saying that the site was down and could I have a look to see
if I could bring it back up. After a little poking about I realised
that the disk had run out of space, so I deleted some spare backups
and old binary logs that hadn't been recycled yet and the website
sprang back to life.
</p>

<p>
After some investigation we found a table called <code>cache_metatags</code> that
was about three times the size of the rest of the database. I
discussed it with our web-team lead and we decided to look into it on
Monday. Surely there would be enough disk space for it to last two
days?
</p>

<p>
Ah, the hubris of Friday afternoon IT support staff.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org560d8f9" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org560d8f9">Monday</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org560d8f9">
<p>
So the website was down. It had run out of disk space as soon as it
started running the backup on Friday evening and then spent the next
two days floundering and being generally unhelpful. We don't do
support on weekends, so there wasn't anyone around to fix it.
</p>

<p>
I started by clearing some disk space and it leapt back into life
almost immediately. Then our web-team lead cleared the Drupal caches
and that brought the <code>cache_metatags</code> table down to a few kilobytes.
</p>

<p>
I ran a backup immediately, just to be sure.
</p>

<p>
Looking at the backup log I noticed that the (compressed) database
backup from the previous Tuesday was significantly larger than the
backup from the night before. Nobody could think of anything that had
changed then, and we thought that the increase in the size of the
Metatag cache was probably the culprit.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org113e2ba" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org113e2ba">The Metatag module</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org113e2ba">
<p>
The Metatag module seems to be used for putting ‘meta tags’ into the
html output of the site. I know little about this arcane art, but
apparently they’re useful for search-engines. The module then caches
the meta tags for each page that Drupal renders so it doesn’t have to
recreate them every time someone views the page. I found a discussion
about it caching the tags for 404 pages, which could result in a lot
of excess cached data if someone hit the site with a lot of junk URLs,
but this issue appears to have been fixed, so that was ruled out.
</p>

<p>
To see if I could spot anything unusual I went to the Apache log files
and immediately noticed something. There were an excessive number of
logfiles from Tuesday and Wednesday. We rotate them when they reach
five megabytes, and rarely get through more than two or three in a
day. (There’s a Varnish caching proxy in front of the web server that
catches most requests, so the traffic reaching the back-end is,
generally, fairly low.) We had about <i>thirty</i> for these two days.
Something was clearly not right.

<div id="outline-container-org1fff3b2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org1fff3b2">The logs</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1fff3b2">
<p>
The logs were full of entries with extremely long paths, and they
seemed to consist of repeating segments, like:
</p>

<pre class="example">
/news/2015/apr/sites/all/modules/fwia/css/sites/all/modules/fwia/css/sites/all/modules/fwia/css/fwia.png
</pre>

<p>
There were thousands of them and they all seemed to come from one
search engine optimisation web crawler. I don't know why it was
crawling our site, but it seemed to have got caught in some sort of
recursive loop and hammered through thousands<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup> of
these URLs over the course of about two days.
</p>

<p>
Our web-team lead immediately recognised the partial URLs and that it
was related to an image that a module was putting on certain pages. He
also knew that the image was broken on certain pages, but hadn't
investigated it yet. Once I knew where to look it didn't take me long
to work out what had happened.
</p>

<p>
The image URL was missing a leading <code>/</code>, which meant that instead of
looking for the image in <code>/sites/all/modules/fwia/css/</code>, it was
looking in <code>/news/2015/apr/sites/all/modules/fwia/css/</code>. For some
reason the pages under <code>/news</code> handle any extra data in the path by
ignoring it and displaying the first working URL. This meant that the
site displayed <code>/news/2015/apr/sites/all/modules/fwia/css/</code> exactly
the same as <code>/news/2015/apr</code>, and the broken image URL was:
</p>

<pre class="example">
/news/2015/apr/sites/all/modules/fwia/css/sites/all/modules/fwia/css/fwia.png
</pre>

<p>
which also happily displayed the same, along with it's own broken
image URL.
</p>

<p>
The crawler dutifully followed these broken links, and many others
that lead from these pages<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>, until,
presumably, the URLs got too long or it finally hit its, rather large,
depth limit, all the while generating data for the Metatag module to
cache.

<h2 id="orge042bcc">The moral</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge042bcc">
<p>
Don't backup to the same disk as your data is on, that's just stupid.
</p>

<p>
The problems here are manifold, and we'll be working to fix as many as
we can, but it amuses me that a single missing <code>/</code> could result in a
perfect storm of small issues and take our website down for over two
days.
